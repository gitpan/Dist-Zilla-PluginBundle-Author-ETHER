Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-ETHER

          - support dropped for directly passing stopwords via a mvp argument
            -- it's easier to just use a directive right in pod (and they can
            be added via ConfigSlicer too, if needed)
          - minting process now prompts to create a repository on github
          - alter max_target_perl setting for *this dist itself only* to
            commit to run on 5.16.3+, not 5.8.8+
          - the version of Dist::Zilla used to build this distribution is
            injected as a develop prerequisite for users of the plugin bundle
          - the version of this bundle used to mint a dist is set as the
            minimum version for subsequent builds of the dist
          - after release, the github repository is updated with the
            distribution's abstract as its description, and the metacpan page
            as its homepage.
