          - documented the first version each configuration option was first
            available
          - remove duplicate [MetaConfig] in tests, to avoid issues with meta
            merging in Dist::Zilla 5.022 (RT#99852)

0.077     2014-10-26 21:16:11Z

0.076     2014-10-18 22:07:58Z
          - bump optional dependency on [MakeMaker::Awesome] to avoid old bug
            with loaded modules
          - copy_file_from_release option now appends to, rather than
            overshadowing, the defaults, so users do not need to repeat the
            defaults (which may change over time)
          - reset default eumm_version in MakeMaker plugins to 0, as done in
            [MakeMaker] version 5.020
          - new 'changes_version_columns' configuration option, for
            tweaking [NextRelease] format strings

            Dist::Zilla plugin distributions
          - no longer performing side effects for plugins that are -remove'd
            in the final configuration
          - added [AuthorityFromModule] (twinned for now with [Authority],
            until supported is added in PAUSE)
          - bump prereq on [ModuleBuildTiny::Fallback], to get fixes for
            interaction with [CheckBin], [CheckLib]

0.072     2014-08-20 04:33:59Z
          - fix syntax that parses badly on all perls before 5.21.1 - hey
            that's new enough for everyone, right?

0.071     2014-08-19 01:11:20Z
          - fix test that broke when I released version 0.09 of
            Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::NoTabs
          - remove prereq declaration for plugin that is only actually ever
            used for ether herself
          - now adding all plugins pulled in by the plugin bundle to the built
            distribution's develop prereqs (to add to the plugins outside the

0.070     2014-08-16 18:48:19Z
          - revert git contributor change from v0.069; opened
            (github) CPAN-API/metacpan-web#1270 instead.
          - order contributors by number of commits, descending
          - no longer adding an $AUTHORITY variable to modules, as nothing
            (save Class::MOP, Moose and Moo) has ever used it - this also
            avoids shifting our line numbers by 3

0.069     2014-08-07 02:44:38Z
          - bump prereq on [Git::Contributors] to allow tests to pass when

          - fix test failure when installer's ~/.pause cannot be parsed

          - README.pod is now generated only in the repository, after
            release, so it never shows up in the shipped dist
          - include a default .mailmap in the minted dist; invite the user to
            update .mailmap if the contributor data is not quite right
          - avoid errors from in XS-based distributions where a token Makefile.PL
            is included and we try to generate our own over top
          - more directories added to no_index
          - now instead of installing release with [InstallRelease], switch to
            [Run::AfterRelease] with an author-specific PAUSE URL, to help out
            cpanm-reporter
          - adjust the command that updates the .latest symlink, to account
            for @#$!@#$ incompatibilities between implementations of `ln`

0.067     2014-07-25 01:09:13Z
          - disabled [EnsurePrereqsInstalled] for now - it is too annoying

0.066     2014-07-18 03:25:10Z
          - internally-hardcoded extra arguments to be passed to optional
            plugins are now handled in a more generic way, now encompassing
            all plugins that might be used
          - minted Dist::Zilla plugins now contain an extra bit of needed
            prereq declaration, for valid metadata production
          - airplane mode can now also be enabled via the DZIL_AIRPLANE
            environment variable
          - now converting the main module to README.pod (pod instead of
            markdown) for committing to the repository
          - fix test of expected files produced by bundle to handle the new
            data file put out by [Test::ReportPrereqs] 0.014.
          - XS-based distributions (*.xs files found in repository root) must
            now have a basic Makefile.PL provided to assist development

          - skip running after-build shell commands on systems with no bash,
            to avoid failing tests on various architectures

0.064     2014-05-21 16:56:30Z

            fail if users don't have develop prereqs installed

            broken out into its own distribution
          - removed unnecessary use of StopWords in this dist, dists being
            built and dists being minted

          - minimum perl version really really fixed now
          - drop [Test::UnusedVars] - too many false positives; perl-critic is
            better suited to address these sorts of issues
          - Makefile.PL now checks for 'git' command, so we can get NA reports
            for every smoker that tried to look at us (before attempting to
            install all the prerequisites)
          - customized minting output if the dist is a Dist::Zilla plugin

0.057     2014-04-11 01:04:20Z

          - new "surgical_podweaver" configuration option
          - minimum perl version softened to 5.010, except for when minting
            distributions (still at 5.013002)

0.050     2014-02-13 17:39:49Z
          - adjusted CONTRIBUTING content for XS-based dists - I promise to

            customization
          - added a dummy option for [Git::Check], to work around an issue in
            Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles::_add_bundle_contents

0.047     2014-01-14 05:34:39Z
          - adjusted plugin order so [PkgVersion] gets a chance to insert into
            the first blank line of the package (new in 5.010) before other
            modules insert their code lines
          - pod removed from in the middle of source is now replaced with a
            commented-out version of itself, to avoid altering line numbers

0.046     2014-01-11 19:23:31Z
          - ensure that .pod files are also eligible for indexing
          - minting profile switched to using a dist sharedir to store

            Pod::Weaver 4
          - update generated CONTRIBUTING file to filter out local plugins
            when running 'dzil authordeps --missing', and to mention the irc
            channel when available
          - new "airplane" mode, to faciliate development while the network is
            not available

0.041     2013-11-29 06:02:08Z

0.019     2013-08-21 19:16:27Z
          - now supporting dists hosted elsewhere than github (currently
            gitmo, p5sagit, or other), via the 'server' option
          - Test::Version now runs in strict mode
          - generated clean-namespaces.t test now skips ::Conflicts module
          - [Test::Kwalitee] now included in bundle, rather than adding it
            into the minted dist.ini separately

0.018     2013-08-16 05:11:06Z
          - now using [PromptIfStale] to ensure the plugin bundle is always
            the latest version, and all plugins are checked at release time
          - bring back [Test::CPAN::Changes], now that the spec has become a
            bit more reasonable (removed since v0.015)
          - Changes entries are now made with times in UTC, with a trailing
            'Z' rather than the CLDR 'ZZZZ' format code

0.017     2013-08-04 16:12:17Z
          - update minimum version of perl required, re syntax used in
            templates applied during minting
          - inject a forced dependency on a fixed CPAN::Meta::Check
          - skip pluginbundle tests if .git dir is not present (too many
            plugins rely on git data)

0.016     2013-08-03 19:44:15Z
          - added basic tests for the pluginbundle and minter
          - clean up .ackrc editing at build time

0.015     2013-08-01 23:02:32Z
          - [Test::CPAN::Changes] omitted if its version >= 0.21, pending
            resolution of too-strict datetime formats (e.g. RT#87499)

0.014     2013-07-30 00:25:48Z
          - fix dist.ini munging done at release time (v0.013)
          - injected compile test now also checks files in examples/
          - ExecDir now looks for installable executables in script/, for
            compatibility with Module::Build::Tiny

0.013     2013-07-28 23:59:41Z
          - inserts --ignore-dir line into .ackrc at build time
          - when releasing this pluginbundle, dist.ini is edited (and
            committed) to force a dependency on the newly-released version, and
            all other local dist.inis using this bundle are also edited
            (without committing)
          - issue tracking is disabled in newly-created github repositories

0.012     2013-07-17 01:32:35Z
          - do not require trial versions of [Test::Compile], allowing
            flexibility as which we choose to build with

0.011     2013-07-06 00:59:57Z
          - compile test will also check for warnings, when author is testing

0.010     2013-06-28 18:28:01Z

            'suggests' prereqs
          - release test for unused variables reinstated

0.009     2013-06-20 17:18:12Z
          - 'installer' now defaults to ModuleBuildTiny
          - (experimental) namespaces-are-clean release test added to minting
            profile, although this won't pass for many types of dists as many
            things are sloppy about modifying the package stash

0.008     2013-06-11 22:59:23Z
          - fix bad templating in minted module
          - during minting, push the initial commit to github after creating
            the remote

0.007     2013-05-30 01:48:34Z
          - minting profile updates:
            - extra kwalitee tests enabled by default
            - test now has 'use <main module>;', prefers done_testing,
              and now fails, rather than not compiling
            - main module now avoids the list transformer where it breaks pod
              coverage tests; includes more template pod
          - config option added for changing the installer backend (still
            defaults to MakeMaker, for now)

0.006     2013-05-11 00:06:41Z
          - support dropped for directly passing stopwords via a mvp argument
            -- it's easier to just use a directive right in pod (and they can
            be added via ConfigSlicer too, if needed)
          - minting process now prompts to create a repository on github
          - alter max_target_perl setting for *this dist itself only* to
            commit to run on 5.16.3+, not 5.8.8+
          - the version of Dist::Zilla used to build this distribution is
            injected as a develop prerequisite for users of the plugin bundle
          - the version of this bundle used to mint a dist is set as the
            minimum version for subsequent builds of the dist
          - after release, the github repository is updated with the
            distribution's abstract as its description, and the metacpan page
            as its homepage.

0.005     2013-04-28 15:47:40Z
          - bump version for [Test::Compile] and [Test::CheckDeps] (RT#84900,
            RT#84904, RT#84905)

0.004     2013-04-27 03:56:11Z
          - fix missing .gitignore in minted dists
          - [-Encoding] podweaver plugin added to this distribution and
            minted dists
          - extra stopwords added, after disabling my local aspell dictionary
          - Pod::Weaver plugins used in this bundle are added as runtime
            prerequisites

0.003     2013-04-21 17:22:48Z

          - [Test::UnusedVars] added
          - RT mail link cleaned up
          - bump prereqs for Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::PluginRemover,
            Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes
          - document the multiple mechanisms for adding stopwords (and add the
            [-Stopwords] weaver plugin, which seems to be needed sometimes)

0.002     2013-04-14 22:40:08Z
          - do not index our profiles/, to avoid its contents from showing up
            under "Documentation" on metacpan
          - users of [@Author::ETHER] can now -remove plugins

0.001     2013-04-14 20:52:50Z
